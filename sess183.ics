SUMMARY:Task-Based Programming
DESCRIPTION:A Divide and Conquer Algorithm for DAG Scheduling Under Power 
 Constraints\n\nDemirci, Marincic, Hoffmann\n\nWe consider the problem of s
 cheduling a parallel computation–represented as a directed acyclic graph (
 DAG)–on a distributed parallel system with a global resource constraint–sp
 ecifically a global power budget–and configurable resources, allowing a ra
 nge of different power/performance tradeoffs. Ther...\n\n-----------------
 ----\nDynamic Tracing: Memoization of Task Graphs for Dynamic Task-Based R
 untimes\n\nLee, Slaughter, Bauer, Treichler, Warszawski...\n\nMany recent 
 programming systems for both supercomputing and data center workloads gene
 rate task graphs to express computations that run on parallel and distribu
 ted machines. Due to the overhead associated with constructing these graph
 s the dependence analysis that generates them is often statically ...\n\n-
 --------------------\nRuntime-Assisted Cache Coherence Deactivation in Tas
 k Parallel Programs\n\nCaheny, Alvarez, Valero, Moretó, Casas\n\nWith incr
 easing core counts, the scalability of directory-based cache coherence has
  become a challenging problem. To reduce the area and power needs of the d
 irectory, recent proposals reduce its size by classifying data as private 
 or shared, and disable coherence for private data. However, existing ...\n
