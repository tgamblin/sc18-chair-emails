SUMMARY:Resilience II
DESCRIPTION:Lessons Learned from Memory Errors Observed Over the Lifetime 
 of Cielo\n\nLevy, Ferreira, DeBardeleben, Siddiqua, Sridharan...\n\nMainta
 ining the performance of high-performance computing (HPC) applications as 
 failures increase is a major challenge for next-generation extreme-scale s
 ystems. Recent research demonstrates that hardware failures are expected t
 o become more common due to increased component counts, reduced device-f..
 .\n\n---------------------\nEvaluating and Accelerating High-Fidelity Erro
 r Injection for HPC\n\nChang, Lym, Kelly, Sullivan, Erez\n\nWe address two
  important concerns in the analysis of the behavior of applications in the
  presence of hardware errors: (1) when is it important to model how hardwa
 re faults lead to erroneous values (instruction-level errors) with high fi
 delity, as opposed to using simple bit-flipping models, and (2) ...\n\n---
 ------------------\nPartial Redundancy in HPC Systems with Non-Uniform Nod
 e Reliabilities\n\nHussain, Znati, Melhem\n\nWe study the usefulness of pa
 rtial redundancy in HPC message passing systems where individual node fail
 ure distributions are not identical. Prior research works on fault toleran
 ce have generally assumed identical failure distributions for the nodes of
  the system. In such settings, partial replicatio...\n
