SUMMARY:Clouds and Distributed Computing
DESCRIPTION:Dynamically Negotiating Capacity Between On-Demand and Batch C
 lusters\n\nLiu, Keahey, Riteau, Weissman\n\nIn the era of rapid experiment
 al expansion data analysis needs are rapidly outpacing the capabilities of
  small institutional clusters and looking to integrate HPC resources into 
 their workflow. We propose one way of reconciling on-demand needs of exper
 imental analytics with the batch managed HPC res...\n\n-------------------
 --\nA Lightweight Model for Right-Sizing Master-Worker Applications\n\nKre
 mer-Herman, Tovar, Thain\n\nWhen running a parallel application at scale, 
 a resource provisioning policy should minimize over-commitment (idle resou
 rces) and under-commitment (resource contention). However, users seldom kn
 ow the quantity of resources to appropriately execute their application. E
 ven with such knowledge, over- a...\n\n---------------------\nA Reference 
 Architecture for Datacenter Scheduling: Design, Validation, and Experiment
 s\n\nAndreadis, Versluis, Mastenbroek, Iosup\n\nDatacenters act as cloud-i
 nfrastructure to stakeholders across industry, government, and academia. T
 o meet growing demand yet operate efficiently, datacenter operators employ
  increasingly more sophisticated scheduling systems, mechanisms, and polic
 ies. Although many scheduling techniques already exi...\n
