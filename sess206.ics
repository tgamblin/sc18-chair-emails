SUMMARY:Biology Applications
DESCRIPTION:Redesigning LAMMPS for Petascale and Hundred-Billion-Atom Simu
 lation on Sunway TaihuLight\n\nDuan, Gao, Zhang, Zhang, Liu...\n\nLarge-sc
 ale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on supercomputers play an increasi
 ngly important role in many research areas. In this paper, we present our 
 efforts on redesigning the widely used LAMMPS MD simulator for Sunway Taih
 uLight supercomputer and its ShenWei many-core architecture (SW26010)....\
 n\n---------------------\nExtreme Scale De Novo Metagenome Assembly\n\nGeo
 rganas, Egan, Hofmeyr, Goltsman, Arndt...\n\nMetagenome assembly is the pr
 ocess of transforming a set of short, overlapping, and potentially erroneo
 us DNA segments from environmental samples into the accurate representatio
 n of the underlying microbiomes's genomes. State-of-the-art tools require 
 large shared memory machines and cannot handle co...\n\n------------------
 ---\nOptimizing High Performance Distributed Memory Parallel Hash Tables f
 or DNA k-mer Counting\n\nPan, Misra, Aluru\n\nHigh-throughput DNA sequenci
 ng is the mainstay of modern genomics research. A common operation used in
  bioinformatic analysis for many applications of high-throughput sequencin
 g is the counting and indexing of fixed length substrings of DNA sequences
  called k-mers. Counting k-mers is often accomplis...\n
