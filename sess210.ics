SUMMARY:Large Scale System Deployments
DESCRIPTION:The Design, Deployment, and Evaluation of the CORAL Pre-Exasca
 le Systems\n\nVazhkudai, de Supinski, Bland, Geist, Sexton...\n\nCORAL, th
 e Collaboration of Oak Ridge, Argonne and Livermore, is fielding two simil
 ar IBM systems, Summit and Sierra, with NVIDIA GPUs that will replace the 
 existing Titan and Sequoia systems. Summit and Sierra are currently ranked
  No. 1 and No. 3, respectively, on the Top500 list. We discuss the de...\n
 \n---------------------\nBest Practices and Lessons from Deploying and Ope
 rating a Sustained-Petascale System: The Blue Waters Experience\n\nBauer, 
 Bode, Enos, Kramer, Lathrop...\n\nBuilding and operating versatile extreme
 -scale computing systems that work productively for a range of frontier re
 search domains present many challenges and opportunities. Solutions create
 d, experiences acquired, and lessons learned, while rarely published, coul
 d drive the development of new methods...\n\n---------------------\nPerfor
 mance Evaluation of a Vector Supercomputer SX-Aurora TSUBASA\n\nKomatsu, M
 omose, Isobe, Watanabe, Musa...\n\nA new SX-Aurora TSUBASA vector supercom
 puter has been released with a new system architecture and a new execution
  model to achieve high sustained performance, especially for memory-intens
 ive applications. In SX-Aurora TSUBASA, the vector host (VH) of a standard
  x86 Linux node is attached to the vect...\n
