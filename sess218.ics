SUMMARY:Performance Optimization Studies
DESCRIPTION:Lessons Learned from Analyzing Dynamic Promotion for User-Leve
 l Threading\n\nIwasaki, Amer, Taura, Balaji\n\nA performance vs. practical
 ity trade-off exists between user-level threading techniques. The communit
 y has settled mostly on a black-and-white perspective; fully fledged threa
 ds assume that suspension is imminent and incur overheads when suspension 
 does not take place, and run-to-completion threads ...\n\n----------------
 -----\nMany-Core Graph Workload Analysis\n\nEyerman, Heirman, Du Bois, Fry
 man, Hur\n\nGraph applications have specific characteristics that are not 
 common in other application domains. In this paper, we analyze multiple gr
 aph applications on current multi- and many-core processors and provide co
 nclusions and recommendations for future designs. We provide new insights 
 on executing gra...\n\n---------------------\nTopology-Aware Space-Shared 
 Co-Analysis of Large-Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations\n\nMalakar, Muns
 on, Knight, Vishwanath, Papka\n\nAnalysis of scientific simulation data ca
 n be concurrently executed with simulation either in time- or space-shared
  mode. This mitigates the I/O bottleneck.  However it results in either st
 alling the simulation for performing the analysis or transferring data for
  analysis. In this paper, we improve ...\n
