SUMMARY:File Systems: Data Movement and Provenance
DESCRIPTION:A Year in the Life of a Parallel File System\n\nLockwood, Snyd
 er, Wang, Byna, Carns...\n\nI/O performance is a critical aspect of data-i
 ntensive scientific computing.  We seek to advance the state of the practi
 ce in understanding and diagnosing I/O performance issues through investig
 ation of a comprehensive I/O performance data set that captures a full yea
 r of production storage activity...\n\n---------------------\nDac-Man: Dat
 a Change Management for Scientific Datasets on HPC Systems\n\nGhoshal, Ram
 akrishnan, Agarwal\n\nScientific data is growing rapidly and often changes
  due to instrument configurations, software updates, or quality assessment
 s. These changes in datasets can result in significant waste of compute an
 d storage resources on HPC systems as downstream pipelines are reprocessed
 . Data changes need to be ...\n\n---------------------\nStacker: An Autono
 mic Data Movement Engine for Extreme-Scale Data Staging-Based In Situ Work
 flows\n\nSubedi, Davis, Duan, Klasky, Kolla...\n\nData staging and in situ
  workflows are being explored extensively as an approach to address data-r
 elated costs at very large scales. However, the impact of emerging storage
  architectures (e.g., deep memory hierarchies and burst buffers) upon data
  staging solutions remains a challenge. In this paper,...\n
