SUMMARY:MPI Optimization and Characterization
DESCRIPTION:Characterization of MPI Usage on a Production Supercomputer\n\
 nChunduri, Parker, Balaji, Harms, Kumaran\n\nMPI is the most prominent pro
 gramming model used in scientific computing today.  Despite it's importanc
 e, however, how scientific applications use it in production is not very w
 ell understood due to the lack of low overhead profiling tools.   We used 
 a lightweight profiling tool, called autoperf, to...\n\n------------------
 ---\nFramework for Scalable Intra-Node Collective Operations Using Shared 
 Memory\n\nJain, Kaleem, Balmana, Langer, Durnov...\n\nCollective operation
 s are used in MPI programs to express common communication patterns, colle
 ctive computations, or synchronizations. In many collectives, such as barr
 ier or allreduce, the intra-node component of the collective is in the cri
 tical path, as the inter-node communication cannot start u...\n\n---------
 ------------\nCooperative Rendezvous Protocols for Improved Performance an
 d Overlap\n\nChakraborty, Bayatpour, Hashmi, Subramoni, Panda\n\nWith the 
 emergence of larger multi-/many-core clusters, performance of large messag
 e communication is becoming more important. MPI libraries use different Re
 ndezvous protocols to perform large message communication. However, existi
 ng Rendezvous protocols do not consider the overall communication pat...\n
