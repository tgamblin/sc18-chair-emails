SUMMARY:Arithmetic and Optimization
DESCRIPTION:ADAPT: Algorithmic Differentiation Applied to Floating-Point P
 recision Tuning\n\nMenon, Lam, Osei-Kuffuor, Schordan, Lloyd...\n\nHPC app
 lications extensively use floating point arithmetic operations to solve co
 mputational problems in various domains. Mixed precision computing, use of
  lowest precision data type sufficient to achieve a desired accuracy, have
  been explored to improve performance, reduce power consumption and dat...

  Register Pressure\n\nRawat, Sukumaran-Rajam, Rountev, Rastello, Pouchet..
 .\n\nRegister allocation is generally considered a practically solved prob
 lem. For most applications, the register allocation strategies in producti
 on compilers are very effective in controlling the number of loads/stores 
 and register spills. However, existing register allocation strategies are 
 not effec...\n\n---------------------\nHarnessing GPU's Tensor Cores Fast 
 FP16 Arithmetic to Speedup Mixed-Precision Iterative Refinement Solvers\n\
 nHaidar, Tomov, Dongarra, Higham\n\nThe use of low-precision arithmetic in
  computing methods has been a powerful tool to accelerate numerous scienti
 fic computing applications including Artificial Intelligence. We present a
 n investigation showing that other HPC applications can harness this power
  too, and in particular, the general HPC...\n
