SUMMARY:Resilience III: GPUs
DESCRIPTION:PRISM: Predicting Resilience of GPU Applications Using Statist
 ical Methods\n\nKalra, Previlon, Li, Rubin, Kaeli\n\nAs Graphics Processin
 g Units (GPUs) become more pervasive in HPC and safety-critical domains, e
 nsuring that GPU applications can be protected from data corruption grows 
 in importance. Despite prior efforts to mitigate errors, we still lack a c
 lear understanding of how resilient these applications ar...\n\n----------
 -----------\nFault Tolerant One-Sided Matrix Decompositions on Heterogeneo
 us Systems with GPUs\n\nChen, Li, Li, Liang, Wu...\n\nCurrent algorithm-ba
 sed fault tolerance (ABFT) approach for one-sided matrix decomposition on 
 heterogeneous systems with GPUs have following limitations: (1) they do no
 t provide sufficient protection as most of them only maintain checksum in 
 one dimension; (2) their checking scheme is not efficient ...\n\n---------
 ------------\nOptimizing Software-Directed Instruction Replication for GPU
  Error Detection\n\nMahmoud, Hari, Sullivan, Tsai, Keckler\n\nApplication 
 execution on safety-critical and high-performance computer systems must be
  resilient to transient errors. As GPUs become more pervasive in such syst
 ems, they must supplement ECC/parity for major storage structures with rel
 iability techniques that cover more of the GPU hardware logic.  In...\n
