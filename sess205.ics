SUMMARY:Non-Volatile Memory
DESCRIPTION:DRAGON: Breaking GPU Memory Capacity Limits with Direct NVM Ac
 cess\n\nMarkthub, Belviranli, Lee, Vetter, Matsuoka\n\nHeterogeneous compu
 ting with accelerators is growing in importance in high performance comput
 ing (HPC). Recently, application datasets have expanded beyond the memory 
 capacity of these accelerators, and often beyond the capacity of their hos
 ts. Meanwhile, nonvolatile memory (NVM) storage has emerged...\n\n--------
 -------------\nSiena: Exploring the Design Space of Heterogeneous Memory S
 ystems\n\nPeng, Vetter\n\nMemory systems are crucial to the performance, p
 ower, and cost of high-performance computing systems. Recently, multiple f
 actors are driving the need for more complex, deep memory hierarchies. How
 ever, architects and customers are struggling to design memory systems tha
 t effectively balance multiple...\n\n---------------------\nRuntime Data M
 anagement on Non-Volatile Memory-Based Heterogeneous Memory for Task-Paral
 lel Programs\n\nWu, Ren, Li\n\nNon-volatile memory (NVM) provides a scalab
 le solution to replace DRAM as main memory. Because of relatively high lat
 ency and low bandwidth of NVM (comparing with DRAM), NVM often pairs with 
 DRAM to build a  heterogeneous main memory system (HMS). Deciding data pla
 cement on NVM-based HMS is critical...\n
