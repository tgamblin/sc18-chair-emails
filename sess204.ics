SUMMARY:Physics and Tensor Applications
DESCRIPTION:Simulating the Wenchuan Earthquake with Accurate Surface Topog
 raphy on Sunway TaihuLight\n\nChen, Fu, Wei, He, Zhang...\n\nThis paper re
 ports our efforts on performing 50-m resolution earthquake simulation of t
 he Wenchuan Earthquake (Ms 8.0, China) on Sunway TaihuLight. To accurately
  capture the surface topography, we adopt a curvilinear grid finite-differ
 ence method with a traction image free surface implementation and...\n\n--
 -------------------\nAccelerating Quantum Chemistry with Vectorized and Ba
 tched Integrals\n\nHuang, Chow\n\nThis paper presents the first quantum ch
 emistry calculations using a recently developed vectorized library for com
 puting electron repulsion integrals. To lengthen the SIMD loop and thus im
 prove SIMD utilization, the approach used in this paper is to batch togeth
 er the computation of multiple integra...\n\n---------------------\nHigh-P
 erformance Dense Tucker Decomposition on GPU Clusters\n\nChoi, Liu, Chakar
 avarthy\n\nThe Tucker decomposition method is one of the most popular algo
 rithms for analyzing and compressing data with multi-way relationship. Its
  execution time is typically dominated by dense matrix multiplication, whi
 ch makes it well-suited for GPU acceleration. State-of-the-art distributed
  dense Tucker i...\n
