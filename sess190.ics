SUMMARY:Deep Learning
DESCRIPTION:CosmoFlow: Using Deep Learning to Learn the Universe at Scale\
 n\nMathuriya, Bard, Mendygral, Meadows, Arnemann...\n\nDeep learning is a 
 promising tool to determine the physical model that describes our universe
 .   To handle the considerable computational cost of this problem, we pres
 ent CosmoFlow: a highly scalable deep learning application built on top of
  the TensorFlow framework.\n\nCosmoFlow uses efficient implem...\n\n------
 ---------------\nAnatomy of High-Performance Deep Learning Convolutions on
  SIMD Architectures\n\nGeorganas, Avancha, Banerjee, Kalamkar, Henry...\n\
 nConvolution layers are prevalent in many classes of deep neural networks,
  including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which provide state-of-the
 -art results for tasks like image recognition, neural machine translation,
  and speech recognition. The computationally expensive nature of a convolu

 treamlining DNN Ensemble Training Pipelines\n\nPittman, Guan, Shen, Lim, P
 atton\n\nParallel training of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) ensemble on a cl
 uster of nodes is a common practice to train multiple models in order to c
 onstruct a model with a higher prediction accuracy. Existing ensemble trai
 ning pipelines can perform a great deal of redundant operations, resulting
  in unnecessa...\n
