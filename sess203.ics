SUMMARY:Resilience
DESCRIPTION:GPU Age-Aware Scheduling to Improve the Reliability of Leaders
 hip Jobs on Titan\n\nZimmer, Maxwell, McNally, Atchley, Vazhkudai\n\nThe i
 ncreasing rate of failures on the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility'
 s (OLCF) Titan supercomputer, resulted in the replacement of 50% of its GP
 Us between 2015 and 2017. The largest jobs, also known as "leadership jobs
 '', continued to experience increased application failures. These jobs co.

 n on Supercomputers\n\nDas, Mueller, Hargrove, Roman, Baden\n\nPredicting 
 which node will fail and how soon remains a challenge for HPC resilience, 
 yet may pave the way to exploiting proactive remedies before jobs fail. No
 t only for increasing scalability up to exascale systems, but even for con
 temporary supercomputer architectures does it require substantial e...\n\n
 ---------------------\nFlipTracker: Understanding Natural Error Resilience
  in HPC Applications\n\nGuo, Li, Laguna, Schulz\n\nAs high-performance com
 puting systems scale in size and computational power, the danger of silent
  errors, i.e., errors that can bypass hardware detection mechanisms and im
 pact application state, grows dramatically. Consequently, applications run
 ning on HPC systems need to exhibit resilience to such ...\n
