SUMMARY:Resource Management and Interference
DESCRIPTION:Mitigating Inter-Job Interference Using Adaptive Flow-Aware Ro
 uting\n\nSmith, Cromey, Lowenthal, Domke, Jain...\n\nOn most high performa
 nce computing platforms, applications share network resources with other j
 obs running concurrently on the system.  Inter-job network interference ca
 n have a significant impact on the performance of communication-intensive 
 applications, and no satisfactory solutions yet exist for...\n\n----------
 -----------\nRM-Replay: A High-Fidelity Tuning, Optimization and Explorati
 on Tool for Resource Management\n\nMartinasso, Gila, Bianco, Alam, McMurtr
 ie...\n\nLeading hybrid and heterogeneous supercomputing systems process h
 undreds of thousands of jobs using complex scheduling algorithms and param
 eters. The centers operating these systems aim to achieve higher levels of
  resource utilization while being restricted by compliance with policy con
 straints. The...\n\n---------------------\nEvaluation of an Interference-F
 ree Node Allocation Policy on Fat-Tree Clusters\n\nPollard, Jain, Herbein,
  Bhatele\n\nInterference between jobs competing for network bandwidth on a
  fat-tree cluster can cause significant variability and degradation in per
 formance. These performance issues can be mitigated or completely eliminat
 ed if the resource allocation policy takes the network topology into accou
 nt when allocati...\n
