SUMMARY:Next-Generation Networking
DESCRIPTION:Exploiting Idle Resources in a High-Radix Switch for Supplemen
 tal Storage\n\nBlumrich, Jiang, Dennison\n\nA general-purpose switch for a
  high-performance network is usually designed with symmetric ports providi
 ng credit-based flow control and error recovery via link-level retransmiss
 ion. Because port buffers must be sized for the longest links and modern a
 symmetric network topologies have a wide range o...\n\n-------------------
 --\nLight-Weight Protocols for Wire-Speed Ordering\n\nEberle, Dennison\n\n
 We describe light-weight protocols for selective packet ordering in out-of
 -order networks that carry memory traffic. The protocols are designed for 
 heterogeneous high-performance systems, in particular, accelerated systems
  with endpoints that have few resources available for interfacing the netw
 ork....\n\n---------------------\nFine-Grained, Multi-Domain Network Resou
 rce Abstraction as a Fundamental Primitive to Enable High-Performance, Col
 laborative Data Sciences\n\nXiang, Zhang, Wang, Liu, Guok...\n\nMulti-doma
 in network resource reservation systems are being deployed, driven by the 
 demand and substantial benefits of providing predictable network resources
 . However, a major lack of existing systems is their coarse granularity, d
 ue to the participating networksâ€™ concern of revealing sensitive inf...\n
