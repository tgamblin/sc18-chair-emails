SUMMARY:Graph Algorithms and Systems
DESCRIPTION:iSpan: Parallel Identification of Strongly Connected Component
 s with Spanning Trees\n\nJi, Liu, Huang\n\nDetecting strongly connected co
 mponents (SCCs) in a directed graph is crucial for understanding the struc
 ture of graphs. Most real-world graphs have one large SCC that contains th
 e majority of the vertices, and many small SCCs whose sizes are reversely 
 proportional to the frequency of their occurren...\n\n--------------------
 -\nfaimGraph: High Performance Management of Fully-Dynamic Graphs Under Ti
 ght Memory Constraints on the GPU\n\nWinter, Mlakar, Zayer, Seidel, Steinb
 erger\n\nIn this paper, we present a fully-dynamic graph data structure fo
 r the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). It delivers high update rates while 
 keeping a low memory footprint using autonomous memory management directly
  on the GPU. The data structure is fully-dynamic, allowing not only for ed
 ge but also v...\n\n---------------------\nAdaptive Anonymization of Data 
 with b-Edge Covers\n\nKhan, Choromanski, Pothen, Ferdous, Halappanavar...\
 n\nWe explore the problem of sharing data that pertains to individuals wit
 h anonymity guarantees, where each user requires a desired level of privac
 y.  We propose the first shared-memory as well as distributed memory paral
 lel algorithms for the adaptive anonymity problem that achieves this goal,
  and pr...\n
