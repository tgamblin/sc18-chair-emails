SUMMARY:Astrophysics Applications
DESCRIPTION:Phase Asynchronous AMR Execution for Productive and Performant
  Astrophysical Flows\n\nFarooqi, Nguyen, Zhang, Almgren, Shalf...\n\nAdapt
 ive Mesh Refinement (AMR) is an approach to solving PDEs that reduces the 
 computational and memory requirements at the expense of increased communic
 ation. Although adopting asynchronous execution can overcome communication
  issues, manually restructuring an AMR application to realize asynchrony .
 ..\n\n---------------------\nComputing Planetary Interior Normal Modes wit
 h a Highly Parallel Polynomial Filtering Eigensolver\n\nShi, Li, Xi, Saad,
  de Hoop\n\nA highly parallel algorithm has been developed and exploited t
 o compute the planetary normal modes of the elastic-gravitational system, 
 which is approximated via the mixed finite element method on unstructured 
 tetrahedral meshes. The eigenmodes of the relevant generalized eigenvalue 
 problem were ext...\n
