SUMMARY:Performance and Energy Analysis
DESCRIPTION:HPL and DGEMM Performance Variability on the Xeon Platinum 816
 0 Processor\n\nMcCalpin\n\nDuring initial testing of a large cluster equip
 ped with Xeon Platinum 8160 processors, we observed infrequent, but signif
 icant, performance drops in HPL benchmark results. The variability was see
 n in both single node and multi-node runs, with approximately 0.4% of resu
 lts more than 10% slower than t...\n\n---------------------\nEnergy Effici
 ency Modeling of Parallel Applications\n\nEndrei, Jin, Dinh, Abramson, Pox
 on...\n\nEnergy efficiency has become increasingly important in high perfo
 rmance computing (HPC), as power constraints and costs escalate. Workload 
 and system characteristics form a complex optimization search space in whi
 ch optimal settings for energy efficiency and performance often diverge. T
 hus, we must ...\n\n---------------------\nA Parallelism Profiler with Wha
 t-If Analyses for OpenMP Programs\n\nBoushehrinejadmoradi, Yoga, Nagarakat
 te\n\nThis paper proposes OMP-WHIP, a profiler that measures inherent para
 llelism in the program for a given input and provides what-if analyses to 
 estimate improvements in parallelism. We propose a novel OpenMP series par
 allel graph representation (OSPG) that precisely captures series-parallel 
 relations ...\n
