SUMMARY:Programming Systems Tools
DESCRIPTION:Dynamic Data Race Detection for OpenMP Programs\n\nGu, Mellor-
 Crummey\n\nTwo concurrent accesses to a shared variable that are unordered
  by synchronization are said to be a data race if at least one access is a
  write. Data races cause shared memory parallel programs to behave unpredi
 ctably. This paper describes ROMP -- a tool for detecting data races in ex
 ecutions of sca...\n\n---------------------\nParSy: Inspection and Transfo
 rmation of Sparse Matrix Computations for Parallelism\n\nCheshmi, Kamil, M
 ills Strout, Mehri Dehnavi\n\nIn this work, we describe ParSy, a framework
  that uses a novel inspection strategy along with a simple code transforma
 tion to optimize parallel sparse algorithms for shared memory processors. 
 Unlike existing approaches that can suffer from load imbalance and excessi
 ve synchronization, ParSy uses a n...\n\n---------------------\nDetecting 
 MPI Usage Anomalies via Partial Program Symbolic Execution\n\nYe, Zhao, Sa
 rkar\n\nMPI is a message passing based programming model for distributed-m
 emory parallelism that has been had been widely used for programming super
 computers for over 25 years. However, debugging and verification of MPI pr
 ograms is widely recognized to be a deep technical challenge. This challen
 ge is furthe...\n
